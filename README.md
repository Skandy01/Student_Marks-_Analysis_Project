# Gender Distribution:
Female students outnumber male students in the dataset.

# Parental Education and Student Scores:
Students with parents holding master's degrees tend to have higher average scores across all subjects compared to other educational levels.
A heatmap visualization demonstrates the positive correlation between parental education levels and student performance.

# Parental Marital Status and Student Scores:
There's no significant variation in student scores based on parental marital status, as indicated by a heatmap.

# Weekly Study Hours and Student Scores:
Students who study for more than 10 hours weekly tend to have slightly higher average scores in all subjects compared to those who study fewer hours.

# Distribution of Ethnic Groups:
The dataset contains students from different ethnic groups (A, B, C, D, E), with group C being the largest.
A pie chart and countplot visualize the distribution of ethnic groups in the dataset.

These insights provide valuable information about the factors influencing student academic performance, which can inform educational strategies and interventions.


# Conclusion

Conducted a comprehensive analysis of a dataset comprising 30,641 records from Amazon, focusing on student demographics and academic performance. Utilized Python libraries including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysis. Identified key insights such as a gender distribution where female students constituted 57% of the dataset. Analyzed the impact of parental education levels on student scores, revealing that students with parents holding master's degrees scored 6% higher on average compared to other educational levels. Explored correlations between parental marital status, weekly study hours, and student performance. Presented findings through insightful visualizations including heatmaps and boxplots, offering actionable insights for educational strategies.
